<p>From wikipedia - Over 800 miles (1,300 km) of trails are available to hikers[8]—everything from an easy stroll to a challenging mountain hike, or backpacking trips. The popular Half Dome hike to the summit of Half Dome requires a permit whenever the cables are up (usually from Memorial Day weekend to Columbus Day).[128] A maximum of 300 hikers, selected by lottery, are permitted to advance beyond the base of the subdome each day, including 225 day hikers and 75 backpackers.[129]

The park can be divided into five sections—Yosemite Valley, Wawona/Mariposa Grove/Glacier Point, Tuolumne Meadows, Hetch Hetchy, and Crane Flat/White Wolf.[130] Numerous books describe park trails, while the National Park Service provides free information.

Between late spring and early fall, much of the park can be accessed for backpacking trips. All overnight trips into the back country require a wilderness permit[131] and most require approved bear-resistant food storage.[132] </p>

<h4> General Sherman Tree </h4>
<p>The Main Parking and Trailhead are just off Wolverton Road, which leaves the Generals Highway just north of the Sherman Tree area (between Lodgepole and the Sherman Tree). From this parking area, the 1/2-mile (.72 km) trail descends and includes some stairs. Rest on the benches along the trail; don't overexert yourself at this elevation (7000'/175m) if you are not accustomed to it. For accessible parking and an accessible trail, stop at the small parking area along the Generals Highway two miles (3.2 km) north of the Giant Forest Museum. When the free park shuttles are running (late May to early September and, some years, Thanksgiving and Christmas/New Years), you can park at the main lot, walk down to the tree, then continue towards the Generals Highway to catch a shuttle back to the main parking. </p>

<h4> Congress Trail </h4>

<p>Hundreds of monarch sequoias grow in the Giant Forest sequoia grove. The Congress Trail, a paved two-mile loop that begins near the Sherman Tree, offers excellent opportunities to see notable trees. For a longer walk, explore the many miles of trails in the area.</p>

<h4> The Big Trees Trail </h4>

<p>This 0.75 mile (1 km) trail circles Round Meadow. Colorful trailside panels describe sequoia ecology. Start at Giant Forest Museum and follow the paved, accessible trail from there. Parking for people with disability placards is available at the trailhead. Allow 1 hour round trip.</p>
